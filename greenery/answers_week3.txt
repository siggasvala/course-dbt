What is our overall conversion rate?
578 unique sessions but 361 with. Conversion rate is 62.5 %. 
I used fact_session_order. 

What is our conversion rate by product?
For product conversion rate I found String of Pearls to have the highest (61 %).
I used the following SQL
WITH
pageviews AS (
  SELECT
    product_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) as num_page_views
  FROM 
    dbt.dbt_sigga_j.fact_pageviews
  GROUP BY 
    1
), 

purchases AS (
  SELECT 
    product_id, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) num_purchases
  FROM 
    dbt.dbt_sigga_j.stg_order_items
  GROUP BY 
    1
)
SELECT 
  dp.product_name,
  pv.product_id,
  pv.num_page_views,
  p.num_purchases, 
  (CAST(p.num_purchases AS FLOAT) / CAST(pv.num_page_views AS FLOAT)) AS product_conversion_rate
FROM 
  pageviews AS pv
JOIN 
  purchases as p 
USING
  (product_id)
JOIN 
  dbt.dbt_sigga_j.dim_products AS dp 
ON
  dp.product_id=pv.product_id
ORDER BY 4 DESC
